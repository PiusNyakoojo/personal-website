							Hi, welcome to my personal website!
						</p>
						<p>
							My name is Pius and I love learning new things and applying that knowledge to make cool stuff.
						</p>
						<p>
							In my free time I enjoy making games for the web, experimenting, jogging, playing tennis or 
							eating green tea ice cream.
						</p>
						<p>
							You can find most of the interesting software-related projects I’ve worked on in this 
							<a [routerLink]="['/portfolio']">Portfolio</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							My <a [routerLink]="['/lab']">Lab</a> contains documentation of interesting experiments that I run. I expect most of the 
							experiments will be related to genetics, acoustic physics and robotics.
						</p>
						<p>
							To bring everything together is what this <a [routerLink]="['/blog']">Blog</a> is for. Here I’ll talk about whatever’s on my 
							mind.
						</p>
						<p>
							I feel that it’s very important to empower ourselves through sharing alternate perspectives.
			 				When we empower ourselves, we unconsciously give others the permission to do the same.
